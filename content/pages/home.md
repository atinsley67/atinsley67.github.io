Your type of adventures might change a bit, but I am here to help you navigate an active momma lifestyle.\_\n\nI am a momma of two boys and girl, I had 3 kids in 4 years. I am here to inspire you to stay active during the different phases of your mom life, as well as grow the love of the outdoors to your kids.\_\n\nThe best way to keep an outdoor active lifestyle is to incorporate your kids from a young age. Then, as your kids grow you can continue your love of the outdoors together!\n\nSome of my favorite things to do with my kids is to\_Hike\_and\_Cycle\_with my kids. But when stuck at home you can find us all\_outside exploring!\n"
